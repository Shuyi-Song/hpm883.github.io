## Overview
HPM 883 is an advanced graduate-level course designed to equip PhD students in the Health Policy and Management program with sophisticated quantitative research skills. This course represents the third installment in the quantitative methods sequence, building on the foundational knowledge acquired in previous courses.

Throughout the term, students will delve into experimental methods pertinent to health services research, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how to design, conduct, and analyze experiments within this field. The course will also provide a thorough introduction to both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, as well as explore the burgeoning domain of causal machine learning.

To facilitate a deep and practical understanding of these complex topics, HPM 883 employs a "flipped" classroom structure. Students will be expected to engage with recorded lectures and complete assigned readings at home. Classroom time will then be dedicated to hands-on data analysis using the R programming language, allowing for immediate application of theoretical concepts to real-world datasets.

This interactive approach not only fosters a collaborative learning environment but also ensures that students are well-prepared to employ advanced quantitative methods in their own research. By the end of the course, participants will have developed a robust skill set, enabling them to confidently tackle intricate analytical challenges in health policy and management research.

* Gradescope [here](https://www.gradescope.com/)  See it for assignments.
* Slack - We have a Slack workspace for the course which you should use to communicate both with us as instructors, and with your fellow students. You can sign up via this link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/hpm883/shared_invite/zt-2vvlfml0i-9_LL6M_rz416NeDMZT4Gqw)

## Course Format

* Flipped classroom – Recorded lectures and readings to be completed outside of class; in-class lab exercise focused on practical data analysis.
* Lab exercise - Computer-based exercises will feature prominently in the course, especially in the lab sessions.  The use of all software tools will be explained in the sessions, including how to download and install them.  All of the class work will be done using R, using publicly available packages.
