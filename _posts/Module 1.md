- **R**: [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

To ensure a seamless learning experience, please complete the following setup tasks before the course begins. This setup will allow you to effectively participate in in-class exercises and complete after-class assignments.


 **Step 1: GitHub Codespaces Setup (for After-Class Assignments)**
1. **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don’t already have one):
   - Sign up for a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. **Enable GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that you’ll use for assignments. To enable it:
     - Navigate to your GitHub repository dashboard.
     - Click on the “Codespaces” tab and follow the prompts to activate it.
3. **Clone the Course Repository**:
   - Click this link to access the course's GitHub repository [GitHub](https://github.com). Clone this repository into your Codespaces environment by following these steps:
     - Open the repository link.
     - Click the green “Code” button and select “Open with Codespaces.”
4. **Verify the Environment**:
   - Use template we provided in class

 **Step 2: Google Colab Notebook Setup (for In-Class Exercises)**
1. **Download the R packages needed for the exercises**:
   - Open this notebook first to download all the R packages needed in class [Before-Class](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shuyi-Song/dhep-analysis-template/blob/master/Before_Class.ipynb).
    
2. **Load In-Class Notebook**:
   - Open In-Class Notebook to ensure it’s functioning correctly [In-Class](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shuyi-Song/dhep-analysis-template/blob/master/In_class.ipynb).

 **Step 3: Recommended Software**
- **Text Editor** (optional but helpful):
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Python extension is recommended for working on Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks locally.
  - Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- **Data Visualization Tools**:
  - Ensure your environment supports plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing experimental results.

 **Step 4: Verification and Support**
- **Test Your Setup**:
  - Complete the introductory lab provided in the course repository to verify your environment.
- **Support**:
  - If you encounter issues, refer to the provided setup guide in the course repository or reach out to the course instructor/TA for assistance.

This setup will allow you to:
- Use **Gradescope** for submitting after-class assignments.
- Engage effectively with **Google Colab Notebook** during in-class exercises.
