- *Module Overview
**
This module introduces the foundational principles of experimental design, focusing on its role in causal inference within health services research. Key topics include understanding the structure of experiments, the importance of proper design, and hands-on application using computational tools.
- * Learning Objectives
**
- Define the key components of experimental design and their significance in research.
- Explain the role of experimental design in establishing causal relationships.
- Apply experimental design principles using Jupyter Notebook.
